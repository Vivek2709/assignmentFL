# Assignment For QuadB Tech

## Short Description
### I've used separated both screens in the bottomNavScreen; as mentioned, I've used a global theme for a consistent theme and have used "cached network image'' and "flutter_cache_manager" packages for preloading splash screen images in cache in order to fast load it when the application starts.
